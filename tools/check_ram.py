"""Guard the link against growing into NuSystem's fixed RDRAM reservations.

NuSystem does not allocate its framebuffers or its audio heap from the linked
image.  It pins them at absolute addresses at the top of a 4 MiB RDRAM:

    Z buffer     NU_GFX_ZBUFFER_ADDR      0x80000400 .. +320*240*2
    audio heap   N64GAME_AU_HEAP_ADDR      framebuffers - AUDIO_HEAP_SIZE below
    framebuffers NU_GFX_FRAMEBUFFER_ADDR  0x80400000 - 320*240*2*3

Nothing at link time notices when BSS runs past those, and the two 1 MiB
column display list arenas dominate BSS.  An overrun does not fail the build;
it corrupts audio or video at runtime on hardware.  Check it explicitly.
