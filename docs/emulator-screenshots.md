# Emulator screenshots

Capturing the game's interface without a flashcart, a controller, or a TV. One
command replays a written timeline of controller input and writes a labelled PNG
per screen:

```sh
tools/emu/run.sh tools/emu/scripts/tour.txt
```

That produces `build/shots/01-title.png` through `09-camera.png` at native
640×480, straight out of the emulator's framebuffer. The run needs no keyboard,
no window focus, and no desktop permissions, and it lands on the same screens
every time.

This is the tool for the interface and for anything that needs the game
actually running. It is the wrong tool for a question about a model: the world
is different on every run, a script has to walk to whatever it wants to look
at, and the preroll alone is longer than the whole job. Pose the geometry
offline instead -- see [Offline preview](offline-preview.md).

## 1. Install the emulator

```sh
brew install mupen64plus
```

Nothing else is needed. The plugin below builds against the mupen64plus headers
Homebrew installs, and `run.sh` builds it on first use.

## 2. How the input works, and why

mupen64plus reads its controller from an input plugin, so this template supplies its
own: `tools/emu/n64game_input.c` replaces `mupen64plus-input-sdl` with one that
ignores the keyboard entirely and replays a script instead. It also holds the
core library handle, which lets a script ask for a screenshot at an exact point
in the timeline rather than at a guessed frame number.

The alternative -- launching the emulator and driving it with synthetic
keystrokes -- was tried first and is worse in every way. macOS blocks keystroke
injection without an Accessibility grant, SDL only sees keys while its window
holds focus, so the run fights whatever else is on screen, and holding a
direction means hammering the key rather than holding it. The plugin has none of
those problems and produces byte-identical framing across runs.

## 3. Writing a timeline

Scripts live in `tools/emu/scripts/`. One command per line, `#` starts a
comment:

```
wait 400                # neutral controller for 400 frames
shot title              # capture, named 01-title.png
press START 8           # hold START for 8 frames, then release
stick 0 70 150          # analog stick at (x=0, y=70) for 150 frames
stick 0 70 60 L         # ...with L held for the same 60 frames
press A+Z 8             # several buttons at once
stop                    # end emulation
```

Buttons are `A B Z START L R`, the C pad as `CUP CDOWN CLEFT CRIGHT`, and the
D-pad as `DUP DDOWN DLEFT DRIGHT`. Stick axes run -80..80. Every `shot` takes an
optional label; `run.sh` matches labels to captures in order and renames the
PNGs, so the filenames stay meaningful when a script grows.

The optional button list on the end of `stick` is what makes the chorded
controls reachable. Sprinting is L with a deflection, looking around is Z with
one, `L+R` into a stride is the vault, and closing on a block while mining is B
with one. A button step followed by a stick step cannot express any of them,
because the game reads both from the same frame.

A deflection is not an angle. The game shapes the stick before it turns
anything — a radial dead zone at 9 counts, saturation at 64, and a mostly cubic
curve in between, all of it in `player.c` — so a script that wants a gentle
camera move cannot get one by halving a number. Small deflections are much
gentler than their size suggests, and anything under 9 does nothing at all;
a slow turn is a moderate deflection held briefly, not a tiny one held for a
long time. Any script whose framing depends on turning by a particular amount
has to be re-derived when that shaping changes, which is why the turns in
`demo-30s.txt` carry the angle they are aiming for in a comment.

## 4. Durations are rendered frames, not polls

This is the one thing worth remembering. this template reads the pad roughly twice per
rendered frame while it is playing, and far faster than that while it is
generating a world -- the loading screens poll in a tight loop. A timeline that
counts `GetKeys` calls therefore races through world generation and drops
presses the game never observes: the first version of this tool sat on the
CREATE WORLD screen while its script believed it was three screens further on.

So the plugin counts the video plugin's per-frame `RenderCallback` and advances
the timeline only when a frame has actually been drawn, holding one controller
state across every poll within that frame. With that, the core's reported
capture frames match the script's arithmetic exactly, which is the quickest way
to confirm a timeline did what it says.

## 5. Timings that a script has to respect

Two waits in `gui-tour.txt` are not padding:

- **The world preview.** `menuAct` still refuses to *launch* while
  `menu_preview_requested` is set, because the terrain drawn behind the menu
  must match the slot being selected — a full generation is roughly 900
  frames. It no longer drops the press, though: an early START is latched and
  spent the moment the preview lands, so a script that presses too soon now
  advances anyway, at a frame it did not choose. Wait for the build if the
  timeline needs to stay predictable.
- **A `shot` immediately before `stop`.** The core writes a screenshot at the
  end of the frame, so stopping on the next one loses it. The plugin holds
  `stop` back five frames to cover this -- worth knowing if the last capture of
  a script ever goes missing.

## 6. What it is not good for

Emulation here is glide64mk2 with the HLE RSP. It is good enough for looking at
interface layout and nothing more:

- **It flatters the GUI, for three specific reasons.** `initVideo` selects
  `osViModeNtscLan1`, so the console renders 320x240 into an *RGBA5551*
  framebuffer -- 32 levels per channel, not 256 -- and the VI's anti-alias
  filter softens every edge on the way out. The emulator gives you 8-bit
  colour with no VI filter, then the display path adds its own blur on top.
  Captures therefore show none of the banding, dither, or edge softening that
  decides whether HUD text is actually readable. (Gamma is not a difference:
  `osViSetSpecialFeatures(OS_VI_GAMMA_OFF)` turns the VI's boost off, which is
  what the emulator does anyway.)

  `run.sh` captures at 320x240 so at least the geometry is 1:1. `RES=640x480`
  doubles it for inspection, but that is the video plugin resampling, not
  detail the console ever had.
- **Frame pacing is not representative.** See the pacing baselines in the README
  rather than timing anything here.
- **The two hardware faults in the README do not reproduce.** Both the RDP
  pipe-sync hazard and the priority inversion in `callbackGfx` run cleanly under
  emulation, which is exactly why they cost so much to find.
- **Nothing that touches a save can be tested here.** mupen64plus emulates no
  flashcart, so `initStorage` fails, every slot reads as empty, and the title
  screen always takes the *generate* path. The load path -- `beginLoadGame`,
  the sliced payload, checksum verification, backup recovery -- never executes
  under emulation at all. Changes to `engine/src/storage.c` have to go to hardware.

## 7. Cover the states a fresh save does not reach

`gui-tour.txt` starts a new world, so its player carries nothing, and a HUD with
an empty hotbar hides real problems -- the held-item name and the stack-count
labels never draw at all. A tour that is meant to check the HUD has to mine
something first. This is the general trap: an emulator run only exercises the
screens the script walks through, and the states it skips are exactly the ones
that go unreviewed.

## 8. Measuring, not just looking

`loading-progress.txt` is the other kind of script: it does not tour screens,
it samples one thing at a fixed interval so the numbers can be compared. Its
shots are spaced evenly across a world build, and reading the filled width of
the bar out of each PNG is what turned "the bar looks stuck" into a measurement
-- first that the three generation stages take the same wall time as each
other, then that the bar advances 7-9 points per 55 frames from one end of a
build to the other. Both of those went straight into the stage weights in
`worldGenerationProgress` and the `BAR_SHARE` split in `main.c`, which is why
those comments claim measurement rather than estimation.

`world-setup.txt` is the third kind: it walks the create-world flow and
selects every terrain shape in turn, giving each one a full rebuild. That is
what a card claiming to preview the world it is describing has to be checked
against, and it is how the setup card's first draft was caught drawing its
selected row's text in dark ink on an opaque black glyph cell -- invisible,
and invisible in exactly one state no static reading of the code would have
questioned.

## 9. A demo reel, and why it cannot use the terrain

`demo-30s.txt` is the fourth kind of script: it is not there to capture or
measure anything, it is there to be screen-recorded. It runs about thirty
seconds after the world appears -- a pan across the horizon, a short walk, two
blocks mined and one placed back, the pack and the recipe list, then third
person and a sprint -- and stops on its own.

```sh
RES=640x480 tools/emu/run.sh tools/emu/scripts/tour.txt
```

The preroll before it is roughly fifty seconds, nearly all of it the title
card's preview build. Start recording when the world appears.

The thing that shaped this script is that **the world is different on every
run**. `menuPendingSeed` draws the seed from `(u32) osGetTime()` at the title,
and under mupen64plus that is not reproducible: three runs of one unchanged
script gave three unrelated worlds, though it does hold still for stretches of
consecutive runs, which is exactly long enough to be misled by.

So the first draft was tuned to the world in front of it -- walk to that
treeline, turn fifteen degrees onto that trunk, fell it, craft planks and
sticks from what dropped. It is a much better thirty seconds, and it survived
right up until the seed moved. What replaced it only uses what every world
has: the ground is always within reach when you look down, the pack always
opens, and the camera always turns. A blind script also has to keep its walks
short and change heading between them, because it cannot see a hillside
coming, and one long committed heading is how a take ends with the camera
pressed into a wall of dirt or at the bottom of a river gorge -- both of which
happened while this was being tuned.

Anything that needs a *particular* block in front of the player -- felling a
tree, and therefore any real craft -- has to be re-tuned against the world
that boots that day. The technique is in the git history of this file's
script: walk, capture every dozen frames, read the trunk's pixel column out of
the capture, and convert. The view is about 0.2 degrees per pixel at 320x240,
a stick deflection turns `stick_x * 0.1136` degrees per rendered frame, and
the reach is six blocks (nine in third person), which is what the first three
attempts were failing on rather than the aim.

## 10. What this has turned up so far

None of these are fixed:

- **The held-item name collides with the food bar.** `drawHUD` draws it at
  y=190 with a 7-pixel font, and `drawHealth` puts the food pips at y=192..197
  in single-player, so the name is struck through the middle of the hunger row.
  Visible on hardware the moment anything is held; invisible to a tour that
  never picks an item up.
- **The PLANKS recipe icon does not draw its texture.** It captures as a solid
  black square even though `planks_texture` exists and in-world planks render
  correctly. It appears in a different wrong colour on hardware, which is the
  usual signature of a combiner or TLUT state the two rasterisers resolve
  differently.
Fixed since:

- "NO CART SAVE DEVICE" no longer collides with the naming card's `KEY` legend.
  The prompt rows grew from eight pixels to thirteen and the status line moved
  below them, to y=224 — outside the card entirely. Re-captured and clear.
- The INFO screen was unreachable: `game/src/hud.c` rendered the full controls list
  and `menuAct` handled leaving it, but nothing anywhere assigned
  `current_screen = INFO`. It has been deleted rather than given a door, along
  with the three other screen states nothing assigned (`GENERATING`, `LOADING`,
  `LOADING_PREVIEW`) and the column-legend layout API in `graphics.c` that only
  the help screen used.
